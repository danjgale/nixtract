`Niimasker` is a simple command-line wrapper for `Nilearn`'s `Masker objects <https://nilearn.github.io/manipulating_images/masker_objects.html>`_ (hence the name), which let you easily extract out region-of-interest (ROI) timeseries from functional MRI data while providing several options for applying additional post-processing (e.g., spatial smoothing, temporal filtering, confound regression, etc). This tool ultimately aims to extend many of `nilearn`'s powerful and convenient masking features to non-Python users (e.g., R and MATLAB users) who wish to analyze fMRI data.

In addition to providing a CLI for `Nilearn`'s masking functions, `Niimasker` also generates reports that document the extraction process. A report is generated for each functional image that `Niimasker` processes, and several plots are displayed for quality inspection. The goal is to provide a completely transparent account of your data extraction and post-processing step in your fMRI pipeline, while providing a simple and intuitive interface. To learn more about the outputs of Niimasker, see `Outputs of Niimasker`__.
